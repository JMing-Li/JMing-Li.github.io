### Rebel Prince: The Power, Passion and Defiance of Prince Charles

While Prince Charles's relationship with his parents was set in permanent __frost__, his connection with his sons was almost as uneasy. One of his most painful __recollections__ was of a visit to Kensington Palace while Diana was alive, and the boys were still small. As soon as Harry saw his father, he ran towards him --then suddenly stopped short.

'Mummy says I mustn't.' he cried, just as Charles was about to hug him.

There was only one conclusion to be drawn: Diana had poisoned the boys' minds towards their father.
Afer her death, the brother had to cope with a continuing __onslaught__ of public __revelations__ about their parents' adulterous ralationships. Grieving for his mother, William would say, was especially difficult because 'it was so __raw__', and there was minimal privacy.

And then there was Camilla. Charles's relationship with his sons certainly wasn't helped by her presence -- which was a constant reminder of their mother's __torment__.

In the opinion of some of his stuff, Charles's lifestyle had blind him to his sons' troubles, and he was largely unaware of their coolness towards his __mistress__.

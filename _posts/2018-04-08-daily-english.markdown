## Rebel Prince: The Power, Passion and __Defiance__ of Prince Charles

While Prince Charles's relationship with his parents was set in permanent __frost__, his connection with his sons was almost as uneasy. One of his most painful __recollections__ was of a visit to Kensington Palace while Diana was alive, and the boys were still small. As soon as Harry saw his father, he ran towards him --then suddenly stopped short.

'Mummy says I mustn't.' he cried, just as Charles was about to hug him.

There was only one conclusion to be drawn: Diana had poisoned the boys' minds towards their father.
Afer her death, the brother had to cope with a continuing __onslaught__ of public __revelations__ about their parents' adulterous ralationships. Grieving for his mother, William would say, was especially difficult because 'it was so __raw__', and there was minimal privacy.

And then there was Camilla. Charles's relationship with his sons certainly wasn't helped by her presence -- which was a constant reminder of their mother's torment.

In the opinion of some of his stuff, Charles's lifestyle had blind him to his sons' troubles, and he was largely unaware of their coolness towards his __mistress__.

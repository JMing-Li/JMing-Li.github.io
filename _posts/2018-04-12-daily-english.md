## China, where the pressure to marry is strong, and the device flows online

Every enening, Liang Xuemeng goes online to read the latest postings from Ayawawa, one of China's most popular advice columnists. "I wish I'd started following her before my first marriage failed." said Ms.Liang, 29, an office clerk in Beijing.

Ayawawa is the online name of Ynag Bingyang, one of several online advice dispensers who have won celebrity in China by tapping into urban women's anxieties about finding a men to marry.

She compared managing a relationship to taking an examination. "If there is something wrong with the exam, it's not my job to change how to it works, but to tell my followers how to take the exam and score a high grade under the existing circumstances."

Although women in their 20s are greatly outnumbered by men in the same age group in China, a product in part of the since-abandoned one-child policy and a culture preference for sons, they face enormous pressure to marry. Those who do not have a husband by the age of 27 are routinely branded as "leftover women", with diminishing value in the dating market.

Lu Pin, a founder of Feminist Voices, an online journal devoted to women's issues, said economic progress in China had not been accompanied by progress on gender relations.

"It's sad to see, when the economy has produced so many more opportunities, that getting married is superior to working hard and achieving a successful career," she said.
